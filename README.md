🧠 Jarvis – AI Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a next-gen AI Voice Assistant built in Python that combines Generative AI, Speech Recognition, Automation, and Real-Time Search. Inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man, this project is designed to act as a personal productivity assistant with both voice and GUI support.

🚀 Features

🎙️ Real-Time Voice Interaction – Always listening, with interruptible TTS like Alexa/Google Assistant

🤖 Intelligent Decision Making – Powered by Groq LLaMA3, Hugging Face models, and Cohere API

🔍 Realtime Search Engine – Fetches live web results and summarizes them instantly

🖼️ Image Generation – Uses Stable Diffusion XL to generate images from prompts

📂 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Upload PDFs and get context-aware answers

🖥️ PyQt5 GUI – Interactive graphical interface with microphone toggle, status updates, and assistant messages

⚡ Fast Multi-Command Execution – Supports parallel tasks with threading & subprocess management

📊 Analytics Integration – Visualize insights using Power BI dashboards

🛠️ System Automation – Open apps, send emails, perform file operations, etc.
